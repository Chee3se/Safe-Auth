# A simple Safe Authentication application made with PHP

![Preview](preview.png)

- Uses JWT for authentication
- Has protection against CSRF attacks
- Has protection against SQL injection
- Has protection against XSS attacks
- Has brute force protection

- If you want DDOS protection you can use Cloudflare or any other service that provides it
- If you want to protect against MITM attacks you can use HTTPS (I cant do it because I dont have a ssl certificate)
